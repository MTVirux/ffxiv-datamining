1,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_Q1_000_000","What will you ask about?"
2,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_A1_000_001","Tell me about yourself."
3,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_A1_000_002","Oizys."

11,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_A1_000_010","Nothing."
12,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_100_001","I used to work under Kokkol back in Labyrinthos. Figured I'd join the initiative and put everything I learned on the ark project to good use. These days I help keep the <Emphasis>Galactic Way</Emphasis> shipshape."
13,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_200_002","Thing is, even with all the routine inspections, I'm hardly rushed off my feet. Hence why I've been explaining the gravitational anomalies and whatnot to the newcomers."
14,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_300_003","Engineering gives you an eye for detail, whether that be the inner workings of a propulsion system or peculiarities in the local environment. I'm just glad to share my perspective with the fresh arrivals."
15,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_001","This is the sixth astral body in the RG-4 star system, and it's five-and-a-half carrots from Etheirys─or so I'm told! At any rate, Oizys is the second star we've set foot upon so far."
16,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_110_001","I imagine you saw those glorious rings during the descent. Strange as it might sound, they're actually clusters of fine ice crystals caught in orbit."
17,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_120_001","Sadly, the dense atmospheric aether prevents us from enjoying that delightful sight here on the surface."
18,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_002","Of course, the surface itself is quite the spectacle. According to geochronological surveys, the gravitational disturbances started millennia ago. By all accounts, the star's slowly tearing itself apart."
19,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_003","Then there's the ruins left behind by Oizys's former inhabitants. The research team's taken to calling them the “Voyagers,” but we've yet to figure out what they were doing here, or why they disappeared..."
20,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_004","The site of our base of operations here on Oizys. Considering how many ruins are dotted about, the area probably served as a central hub for the star's former inhabitants as well."
21,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_005","Every relic, large and small, is made from the exact same stuff as the rest of the star. It's almost as if the structures just sprouted from the ground."
22,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_006","The leading theory's that the builders used magic to shape natural matter to their will. One thing's certain─their approach to architecture was vastly different to ours."
23,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_007","That's the arid expanse to the west of the Megalithopolis. Thanks to the gravity storms, there's not much left that hasn't been stripped, shattered, or wrenched from the surface."
24,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_008","It may have looked identical even before the anomalies took hold, though. The comparative lack of relics might simply indicate there were few resources in the region to begin with..."
25,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_009","Erg Eris <Emphasis>is</Emphasis> home to a water source, however. Given how close it is to the Megalithopolis, I daresay the star's former inhabitants made use of it like we do."
26,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_010","The Regolift is a swath of desert stretching eastwards from the north of the Megalithopolis. Not the easiest place to traverse─what with all the clusters of floating rock caught up in the gravity vortex. "
27,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_011","The surveyors have discovered what appears to be a subterranean complex in the north of the sector, so I'm guessing it once thrived with activity in the star's distant past. Warrants further exploration, if you ask me!"
28,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_012","The southern reaches are bounded by an ocean known as the Magnetic Horizon. This is also where you'll find the Unmoored Anchor─what we've taken to calling the great edifice of floating rock over there. If varied environmental conditions tickle your fancy, could be worth a look."
29,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_013","Cape Geras lies southwest of the Megalithopolis, hemmed in on three sides by rocky outcrops, with soft sand beaches leading right to the water's edge."
30,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_014","If you're thinking of unwinding on the shore, though, I'd advise against it..."
31,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_015","According to the research team, the cliffs in the region are teeming with electromagnetic activity─enough to affect living creatures and even water at a molecular level. We recommend prospective visitors don protective gear."
32,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_016","Naught but the edge of a vast, fathomless desert. It's located in the northeast of the region if you want to take a closer look."
33,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_017","Oizys is home to many a gravitational anomaly, but the one above the Moros Well is the closest to the surface─hence the dramatic impact on the landscape."
34,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_018","Whatever was there before got sucked into the vortex, leaving behind a bleak expanse as far as the eye can see. I suppose that's the fate awaiting every last grain of sand on this star..."
35,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_019","Shadefleet's the flotilla of huge stone shards over in the east. I hear it's actually slowly listing toward the anomaly nearby."
36,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_020","When the whole mass became unmoored, countless deep blue mineral veins were exposed. The researchers always joke about it being one giant geological sample!"
37,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_021","They're not wrong, though─the area's rich in natural resources that'd otherwise be malms underground! Just mind your step when you're out exploring the area, you hear?"
38,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_022","The location of a ruin exposed by gravitational anomalies in the north of the region. I have it on good authority that the tunnels discovered are actually the vestiges of a mine plied by those that once called Oizys home."
39,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_023","The research team seem fairly confident in their hypothesis─they say there are signs of mining activity all across the region, in fact."
40,"TEXT_CTSWKS74TERRAFIRMA_00968_UNATOAKHABILA_000_024","If they're right, it stands to reason the Euhedron was also unearthed by the star's former residents."
