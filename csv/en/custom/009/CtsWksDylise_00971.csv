1,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_001","Preparations for the habitation modules are well underway! With their completion, I expect to see an influx of contributors to the Megalithopolis and its environs."
2,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_002","And to cope with the surge in numbers, improvements to the base are also called for─not least to the rainbow crystal's provisional housing."
3,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_003","Still, provisional housing is better than none! The scouting party had a rather torrid time on arrival without the crystal's protection. Only with the aid of gravitational magicks did they manage to gain a foothold."
4,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_003","Completion of the habitation modules marks an important malmstone of our tenure on Oizys. May the benefits of a good night's sleep propel our efforts ever further!"
5,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_004","As you can see, construction teams are currently preparing for an essential infrastructure project. With stable supplies of power and potable water, our endeavors will hopefully be subject to fewer restrictions."
6,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_005","I also requested a habitation module be built next to the energization station for use as a personal laboratory. My research instruments are rather power-hungry, but the close proximity to the power supply ought to prevent any potential issues."
7,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_006","I plan to spend my time there analyzing the reams of data generated by the initiative. I shan't be accepting visitors, though─I'd hate for my colleagues to see me hunched over my desk, surrounded by the inevitable clutter of scientific inquiry!"
8,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_006","I am pleased to say the brand-new energization and hydrofication stations have more than met our infrastructure needs. With this, the initiative's endeavors─not to mention my own research efforts─shall surely flourish!"
9,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_007","Here we shall construct two sophisticated machines for bending gravity to our will. The technology is a remarkable blend of Loporrit ingenuity and gravitational magicks that I am keen to see succeed."
10,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_008","If calculations are correct, the devices will be able to manipulate gravity on a nigh-perpetual basis. What's more, they can assemble the nearby floating rocks into a stable pathway!"
11,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_009","Some suggested we fashion a rudimentary chain bridge between the two points, but the plan was deemed unworkable. The opposing landmass is being inexorably drawn towards the anomaly─there's a risk the chains would simply snap under the strain."
12,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_009","Shadefleet is finally accessible! A good thing too─the sector is said to harbor a wealth of geological marvels."
13,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_010","That giant crystalline form is the Euhedron. Analysis suggests it is composed of a peculiar, highly pure mineral found here on the star."
14,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_011","Structurally, it differs markedly from the rainbow crystal, and appears to house vast quantities of data. By activating it, we hope to access whatever lies within."
15,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_012","Some of our researchers attest that the crystal has structural characteristics in common with fossilized trees─with notable deviations due to mutation, of course. Perhaps Oizys was once heavily forested..."
16,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_012","To think that such a striking emerald hue was hiding beneath the patina of dust and dirt! I cannot wait to begin analyzing the data lurking within."
17,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_013","That said, our efforts seem to have merely been the first step towards restoring the Euhedron's functionality. I wonder if it is damaged in some way..."
18,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_014","The cosmoport continues to evolve. A worthy allocation of resources if it means improved communications with Phaenna and our Studium colleagues."
19,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_013","The nearby anomaly has exposed part of what appears to be an ancient structure. Although it is too soon to draw conclusions, I'm inclined to think this is but one section of a much larger complex. "
20,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_014","If that is the case, there's every likelihood we'll uncover more about the star's previous residents. I, for one, can barely contain my excitement!"
21,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_015","But first we need to shift this mess of debris... Not the most engaging work, I'll be the first to admit─but just think of the potential wonders awaiting us!"
22,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_015","Behold this magnificent portal to the unknown! I am now utterly convinced an expansive structure lies beyond, ripe for exploration!"
23,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_016","Namingway has graciously provided an appellation for these ruins: Desert Burrow. I'm rather fond of it, myself."
24,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_017","Excavation has revealed what appears to be an entrance. At any rate, preliminary scans indicate there is an empty void behind it."
25,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_018","I'm sure you've noticed the two crystalline objects flanking the door. If we're able to activate them, I believe we shall be granted entrance. For all we know, this could be a vast subterranean complex built by the star's former residents!"
26,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_018","Just as I predicted, the crystals by the entrance were key to accessing the interior─and what a spectacular sight it has proven to be! My heart is singing with excitement! "
27,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_019","Since activating the crystals and entering the ruins, our investigation has made considerable progress. As far as we can glean, these passageways are not the result of excavation─at least not in the conventional sense."
28,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_020","We believe the structures forming the Megalithopolis were coaxed from the ground via aetheric manipulation. I posit the same method was used to create these tunnels."
29,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_021","No doubt its builders sought the mineral veins that streak the depths in these parts. In other words, you and I are likely standing in an ancient mine."
30,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_022","As for the crystalline structure, we've taken to calling it the Guide Stone, for it appears to control the ruins in their entirety."
31,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_023","It is unquestionably our next object of study, and pivotal to unlocking the secrets of Desert Burrow. Of this I am sure!"
32,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_023","Here we are in what must be the furthest depths of the ruins, standing before yet another crystal! The next phase of inquiry awaits─but where to begin?"
33,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_024","Awakening the Guide Stone led us here to another crystal slumbering in the ruins: the Metahedron!"
34,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_025","With this latest discovery, I believe we can categorically state these tunnels are the remnants of an ancient mine. At the very least, the crystal appears to have formed here naturally."
35,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_026","Like the Euhedron, the crystal probably functioned as a vast data storage device. Of course, until we activate it, I cannot offer much more than conjecture."
36,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_027","One thing is certain: the Metahedron is in a far better state than its Terra Firma sibling. I daresay its location underground offered a degree of protection against the gravitational anomalies. I have high hopes for a successful reactivation!"
37,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_027","The crystal gleams the same glorious green as the restored Euhedron! We have revealed its color─now to reveal its secrets!"
38,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_028","I'm currently analyzing the data gleaned from our Desert Burrow investigations. I sense we're on the precipice of startling new discoveries regarding the crystals and their true form!"
39,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_028","Our next task is to build a giant aetheric resonator here in the base. The device will compensate for defects and data loss in the Euhedron and secure a path to its complete reawakening!"
40,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_029","Oh, I also have news concerning the Metahedron. Examining its aetherial signature has revealed that it, too, contains a wealth of data."
41,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_030","At this stage, we have only verified the presence of data, not its content or format."
42,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_031","We did, however, ascertain that the Euhedron and Metahedron bear corresponding aetherial signatures. In other words, they likely contain the same data!"
43,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_032","The aetheric resonance device will serve to link the two crystals. By synchronizing the pair, we can theoretically supplement the Euhedron's missing data with that preserved on the Metahedron, thus facilitating the former's restoration!"
44,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_200_032","With the addition of the Orthostat Tower, Terra Firma's evolution is complete. Now we may shift our focus to the Euhedron and its long-awaited reawakening!"
45,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_033","Now that the Orthostat Tower is finished, work may begin on synchronizing the two crystals, restoring the Euhedron, and delving into the star's mysterious past."
46,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_034","If all has gone to plan, the tower should be emitting an unseen torrent of aetherial information as we speak."
47,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_035","Unfortunately, owing to the sheer volume of data involved, it will be some time before the two crystals are synchronized and the Euhedron is restored. Do be sure to check in on progress now and then!"
48,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_036","The research teams and I are busy analyzing the navigational chart that appeared once the Euhedron was reactivated. Simply put, this is the culmination of all our efforts here on Oizys!"
49,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_037","If we can determine the route traversed by the star's former inhabitants, what choice will we have but to set a course for that very location! I sense exciting times ahead for the initiative!"
50,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_038","A detailed exercise and nutrition regimen? Compulsory rest breaks? This vicarious vacationer is reassuringly thorough!"
51,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_000_039","Ah, perhaps there is something you'd like to know about our endeavors on Oizys?"
52,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_Q1_000_000","What will you ask about?"
53,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_A1_000_002","The Megalithopolis."

64,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_001","Constructing the habitation modules was a major malmstone for the initiative. Once they were complete, the Megalithopolis quickly began to feel like a thriving hub of activity!"
65,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_002","Of course, the endeavor demanded significant improvements to the base's infrastructure─the rainbow crystal in particular."
66,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_003","Speaking of which, the scouting party had a torrid time on arrival without any counteracting force to the gravity spheres. Indeed, they had to use gravitational magicks just to gain a foothold!"
67,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_004","Providing sufficient energy and water to meet our needs was an early project goal, lest we were to endure constant shortages. Thus, plans were drawn up for energization and hydrofication stations."
68,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_005","I also had the construction teams build this personal laboratory for me. Given how power-hungry my research instruments are, I deemed it paramount to be close to the energy supply."
69,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_006","And I'm happy to report that I haven't suffered a single power outage! Though the less said about the state of my lab the better─I can never seem to find the time to tidy when I get absorbed in my work..."
70,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_007","With the completion of those sophisticated machines, we gained access to Shadefleet. The technology itself is a remarkable blend of Loporrit ingenuity and gravitational magicks that allows us to bend gravity to our will!"
71,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_008","In theory, the devices will maintain their hold on the floating rock bridge in near-perpetuity."
72,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_009","Some suggested we fashion a rudimentary chain bridge between the two points, but the plan was abandoned. The opposing landmass is slowly shifting towards the gravitational anomaly─we concluded the chains would have snapped under such extreme tension."
73,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_010","The Euhedron is the giant crystalline form in the center of Terra Firma. Our analysis showed it is composed of a strange, incredibly pure mineral found here on Oizys."
74,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_011","Structurally, it differs considerably from the rainbow crystal, and its complex internal circuitry houses vast quantities of data. Thankfully, we were able to reactivate it, and are currently analyzing the information stored within."
75,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_012","Some of our researchers attest that the crystal bears similarities to fossilized trees─albeit nigh mutated beyond recognition. Maybe Oizys was once a more verdant land?"
76,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_013","When an anomaly exposed part of an ancient structure, we began to speculate that a sizable complex lay hidden beneath the sand and rock."
77,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_014","Thinking about what we might uncover filled me with such excitement! I could scarcely restrain myself at the time."
78,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_015","In retrospect, that excitement was premature─for we had an arduous task ahead of us shifting all that debris!"
79,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_016","As you may recall, Desert Burrow is the moniker Namingway bestowed upon the ruins in the north."
80,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_017","Excavating the rubble unveiled a door that scans suggested was mere ilms thick, implying an empty space lay just beyond."

82,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_019","Once we activated the crystals and entered the ruins, our investigation made considerable progress. Interestingly, it soon became apparent that the passageways we traversed were not the result of excavation in the traditional sense."
83,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_020","We believe the various parts of the Megalithopolis were coaxed from the ground via aetheric manipulation, and I posited the same method was used to remove the material necessary to create those tunnels."
84,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_021","I made an assertion─that the tunnels were built in the pursuit of minerals found in the region. In other words, what we had discovered was, in fact, an ancient mine."
85,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_022","We named the first crystal we found within those tunnels the Guide Stone, as it seemed to be a kind of control interface for the ruins as a whole."
86,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_023","It was clear to us that we would need to study the crystal, lest the secrets of Desert Burrow lay forever out of reach."
87,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_024","Awakening the Guide Stone led us to the Metahedron─yet another crystal slumbering in the ruins!"
88,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_025","With that discovery, I was confident the tunnels were indeed the remnants of an ancient mine, for the crystals were clearly natural formations."
89,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_026","Even at the time, we hypothesized the Metahedron stored data in a similar fashion to the Euhedron."
90,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_027","It is worth mentioning that the crystal's excellent condition gave us high hopes we could reactivate it. At any rate, it was in a far better state than we found its Terra Firma sibling in!"
91,"TEXT_CTSWKSDYLISE_00971_DYLISE_100_028","After our successes in Desert Burrow, our sights were set on building a giant aetheric resonator in Terra Firma. We hoped the device would compensate for defects and data loss in the Euhedron and secure a path to its complete reawakening."
