3,"TEXT_KINGKW201_05454_SEQ_03","Upon your arrival, the expedition archaeologist provides a thorough explanation of the three ancient methods she has deemed worthy of further inquiry: “hexcarving,” “Karnak forgecraft,” and “aetheric conversion.” Armed with new knowledge and a sheaf of detailed notes, you make for the smithy to consult with Gerolt. "
4,"TEXT_KINGKW201_05454_SEQ_04","After discussing the matter with Gerolt, the weaponsmith resolves to replicate the technique of aetheric conversion. To begin the process, a selection of ingredients is required, and as the only one free to leave the Occult Crescent, their procurement inevitably falls to you. Gerolt will be waiting by the smithy for your return.

Umbral clay: seek a trader in the markets of Tuliyollal.
Aspected aether agglomerate, aspected aetheroconductor, aspected aetherocatalyst: craft using the relevant recipe or purchase from the market board.

※Should you choose to craft the aspected materials, you will need to have obtained the Master Recipe XII tomes of the Disciples of the Hand."

Hearing the weaponsmith recount the aetheric conversion procedure, it becomes apparent that the creature was inadvertently summoned by his hand. The voidsent itself seems confused, and insists its original form was more powerful, leading Dodokkuli to surmise the vessel Gerolt crafted is somehow unsuitable. To encourage the beleaguered creature to stay─and secure its eventual cooperation in the weapon enhancement process─you form a pact, promising aether in exchange. The next step will be to aid it in unleashing its full potential─though by what means, and to what end, remains unclear..."
