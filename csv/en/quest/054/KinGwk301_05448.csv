1,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SEQ_01","Searchingway's giddiness all but gives away his glad tidings: the initiative has settled on its next destination─currently known only as RG 4-6─which may have once been home to intelligent life. Tempted by the possibility of replacing the star's mundane moniker and putting words to an unknown civilization's remains besides, Namingway gladly agrees to make the journey to this new-to-you star. Likewise, you find the promise of adventure too persuasive to ignore, and require no further encouragement to join the two Loporrits on the voyage."
2,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SEQ_02","Always happy to be of service, the good captain Cruisingway stands ready to launch at a moment's notice. You need only say the word─and possibly brace for impact."
3,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SEQ_03","With Cruisingway at the helm, you arrive safely at RG 4-6, a star afflicted with gravitational aether currents that strip the very land from its surface. In honor of the suffering this nevertheless beautiful world has undergone, Namingway decides it shall henceforth be known as Oizys."
4,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SEQ_04","Once you are settled as firmly on the ground as one can be under such conditions, Searchingway introduces you to Dylise, a Sharlayan scholar working on the <Emphasis>Bibliotheca Historica</Emphasis>. Owing to her expertise in the comparative study of civilizations, Searchingway has tasked her with leading the research effort on Oizys, and she already has a theory: the structures here were built not by indigenous peoples, but visitors like yourselves. This, of course, raises more questions than it answers, but with time and teamwork, any number of truths may be brought to light."

86,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_036","I am Dylise, an editor of the <Emphasis>Bibliotheca Historica</Emphasis> at Noumenon. I specialize in the comparative study of civilizations."
87,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_037","Given that archaeological sites proliferate this star, I thought to offer the initiative my expertise."
88,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SEARCHINGWAY_000_038","And we are ever so grateful to have her at the helm of our research efforts!"
89,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_039","I look forward to working closely with you and the other fine adventurers here."

92,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_041","While we've found no intelligent life lingering amidst the ruins, there are flora, fauna, and minerals in abundance."
93,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_042","The density of the aether across the star─and its instability─are also noteworthy."
94,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_043","These aetherial conditions have resulted in gravitational anomalies such as the one you see above you."
95,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_044","It hangs like a moon, the intensity of its pull waxing and waning irregularly. To approach is reckless at best."
96,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_NAMINGWAY_000_045","Waxing...strongly enough to pull a Loporrit screaming into the sky!?"
97,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_046","You will be reassured to hear that Studium specialists have augmented the rainbow crystal with gravitational magicks to counterbalance the environmental effects at play."
98,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_047","Said effects are not truly <Emphasis>negated</Emphasis>, however─only mitigated. Be mindful of the objects around you, as they may float or fall unexpectedly."
99,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SEARCHINGWAY_000_048","Yet in spite of it all, civilization once flourished here! The structures we've found are proof of that."
100,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_049","Structures with little architectural variation, nor aught suggesting they were constructed over a span greater than a generation. I am inclined to see them as part of an outpost not unlike our own."
101,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_NAMINGWAY_000_050","I believe I catch your meaning! Could it be that their architects came from another star, just as we have?"
102,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_051","The evidence suggests as much. And sheer scale indicates it was more than a mere base of operations for exploration."
103,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_052","The question we must ask, then, is why build a colony here? For what purpose did these visitors come, and whence?"
104,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_053","...Not to mention the looming issue of why they are here no longer. The more we learn, the more mysteries abound."
105,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SEARCHINGWAY_000_054","Just think, <Split(<Highlight>ObjectParameter(1)</Highlight>, ,1)/>: what started as my humble curiosity has led us all the way here, to the discovery of an unknown civilization!"
106,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SEARCHINGWAY_000_055","Who were these people, and what tragedy befell them? These burning questions deserve answers!"
107,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SEARCHINGWAY_000_056","...But to find them, the initiative must leave no stone unturned. Do what you can to lend a paw here on Oizys, and I will keep you apprised of any major developments."
108,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_DYLISE_000_057","Likewise, I shall be in touch, be it via exotablet or another intermediary."
109,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_NAMINGWAY_000_058","Time to roll up the proverbial sleeves. Any stone you turn, I shall name!"
110,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SYSTEM_000_059","You can now explore Oizys. Check your exotablet for the latest information on how to further the Cosmic Exploration Initiative!"
111,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SYSTEM_000_060","You may travel to Oizys from the moon at any time by speaking to either Cruisingway in Sinus Ardorum or Drivingway at Bestways Burrow."
112,"TEXT_KINGWK301_05448_SYSTEM_000_061","Please note that the Loporrits have also recalibrated the Bestways Burrow aetheryte to facilitate one-way travel to this latest stop on the initiative's path to cosmic discovery."
