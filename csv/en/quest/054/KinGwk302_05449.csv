1,"TEXT_KINGWK302_05449_SEQ_01","As you and Searchingway are chatting about your experience on Oizys, Namingway returns, having concluded his newly expanded duties. He invites you to join him on another enlightening stroll to learn more of the nomenclature that he has chosen to bestow upon this gravity-torn star."
2,"TEXT_KINGWK302_05449_SEQ_02","As ever, your tour is to begin with the initiative's base of operations─in this case, Terra Firma. To that end, the two of you will require an unobstructed view of its imposing structure.

※You must be accompanied by Namingway to complete this task. Speak with him again should you become separated."
3,"TEXT_KINGWK302_05449_SEQ_03","Accompanied by Namingway, you observe the greater Megalithopolis, cradled by towering stone. There, he shares his initial fear of being unable to create appellations of equal significance to those that would have once been used on the star─as well as his newfound philosophy that each name has its time and place, and one need not necessarily supplant or belie any others."
4,"TEXT_KINGWK302_05449_SEQ_04","The second stop on Namingway's tour features a pair of impressive stone protrusions. To the west is the Shielding Wall, named for the way it is positioned directly between the Megalithopolis and nearby gravity sphere. To the east, however, is the Falsifying Wall, which shields nothing but empty wasteland despite its grandiose appearance. Your next destination is promised to be more captivating still..."
5,"TEXT_KINGWK302_05449_SEQ_05","The Unmoored Anchor, as Namingway explains it, was named for its metaphorical relationship to Shadefleet rather than any real physical resemblance, this connection created through the use of the newly constructed gravitational generators. Beyond it to the south stretches a striking view of the Magnetic Horizon, which flouts Oizys's anomalous gravity by sheer magnetic force."
6,"TEXT_KINGWK302_05449_SEQ_06","Speaking of gravitational anomalies, stepping into Shadefleet grants you a frighteningly close look at the nearest specimen. Everything from the trees to the very earth has been warped by its influence, but there remain glimpses of a potentially promising future for Oizys. While Namingway cannot but dwell on the past once more, his regrets only become greater motivation to craft monikers with the utmost care."
7,"TEXT_KINGWK302_05449_SEQ_07","Upon your return to the Megalithopolis, Searchingway excitedly informs you of the latest report: the Euhedron is set to be restored in short order. Eager to learn what answers it holds, the three of you hurry into Terra Firma, where you find Dylise wrestling with the terminal. When it finally activates, it displays a strange holographic projection that resembles a navigational chart. Skilled as they were at gravitational magicks, could it be that the Voyagers' repeated interstellar departures were the cause of Oizys's corruption? And if they did leave the star ere its destruction, where did they go?"
