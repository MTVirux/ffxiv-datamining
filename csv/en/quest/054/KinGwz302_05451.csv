52,"TEXT_KINGWZ302_05451_ENGINEER05431_000_005","...Ah, but I am getting ahead of myself. It all started, you see, when someone claimed to have seen a strange...<gulp>...<Emphasis>figure</Emphasis> pursuing them while riding the Cosmoliner."

78,"TEXT_KINGWZ302_05451_ENGINEER05431_000_059","This is why we often must establish stations in dangerous locales. Regulating the environment is much more important when one is atop a levitating landmass or deep beneath the surface."
79,"TEXT_KINGWZ302_05451_ENGINEER05431_000_060","And conditions aren't static, so each station is designed to be installed and uninstalled as needs dictate, with minimal impact to the surrounding environs."
80,"TEXT_KINGWZ302_05451_ENGINEER05431_000_061","...Nevertheless, I'd rather not add “ghostly apparitions” to the list of variables! Our work is hazardous enough."
