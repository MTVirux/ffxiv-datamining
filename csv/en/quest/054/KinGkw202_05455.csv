1,"TEXT_KINGKW202_05455_SEQ_01","Lydirceil believes the voidsent's vessel will need to be crafted anew if it is to leverage its power. The group manages to glean that unlike its current guise, the creature's true form has limbs, and thus a plan emerges. Gerolt, for his part, sees an opportunity to further strengthen the bond between voidsent and vessel through the addition of a material known as “crystal paste” to the mixture used to fashion its body. And thus you find yourself tasked with retrieving one hundred portions of the substance for the weaponsmith.

Crystal paste can be obtained by completing duties.

On the Occult Crescent's South Horn, crystal paste can only be obtained from critical encounters, excluding the Forked Tower: Blood.

You may use the phantom glass to gauge your progress.

※Speak to Lydirceil if you wish to abandon this quest."
2,"TEXT_KINGKW202_05455_SEQ_02","Upon receiving the crystal paste, Gerolt soon fashions a new vessel replete with the requisite appendages. Although the voidsent reports a renewed sense of strength, they complain that their mental faculties are still diminished. Hearing this, the weaponsmith resolves to craft yet another vessel, one that inevitably requires more resources."
3,"TEXT_KINGKW202_05455_SEQ_03","You deliver a fresh batch of crystal paste to Gerolt, who sets about crafting another vessel. The summoned voidsent seems pleased with the latest iteration, although there remains room for improvement. The creature insists its true form was beautiful─and thus the effort to restore this missing element to the vessel begins. According to Gerolt, an even greater quantity of crystal paste will be required. "
4,"TEXT_KINGKW202_05455_SEQ_04","Yet another delivery made, yet another vessel crafted. Alas, though vastly improved, it seems Gerolt's latest rendition is not quite perfect. To well and truly forge a bond between the voidsent and its vessel, additional crystal paste is called for..."
5,"TEXT_KINGKW202_05455_SEQ_05","After much trial and error, not to mention your peerless paste procurement, the vessel is finally complete. Overjoyed at having attained their true form, the grateful voidsent introduces herself as Brigid. She then channels her aether into Gerolt's hammer─as per your pact. Having successfully borrowed the power of the void itself, it will not be long before your phantom weapon is rightfully enhanced."
